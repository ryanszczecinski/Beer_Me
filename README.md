# Beer_Me
hackathon

This is an app that will track your drinking as you progress through the night. 

This app was designed to track your BAC using physical characteristics.

We also implemented a notification system allowing you to view your current BAC and beers consumed from your lockscreen.

A "high-score" tab has been implemented, which is the basis of the more in-depth drinking analytics we plan to formulate.




To use this app, enter your name, weight, and gender and press the enter button. 

Then press start drinking to intitalize a drinking session.

Use the buttons on the bottom to toggle how many beers you have consumed.
